first question :
First, the script checks if the first argument starts with a - (option).
If yes:
It saves the option (like -n, -v, or -vn) into a variable opts.
It then uses shift to move the remaining arguments (search string and file) to $1 and $2.
If no option:
It directly treats $1 as the search string and $2 as the file.
After that:
It checks if both the search string and file are present.
It checks if the file exists.
Then, it constructs the grep command:
Always uses -i (case-insensitive)
Adds -n if needed (line numbers)
Adds -v if needed (invert match)

second question :
i don't know how to restructure it , but i will think about

third question :
hardest part is the arrangment of argument how to deal with 
so i used shift command , which is genius choice
